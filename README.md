# SeminarLearningTheory

This is the code repository for the webpage hosted at [https://pwelke.github.io/SeminarFromTheoryToAlgorithms/](https://pwelke.github.io/SeminarFromTheoryToAlgorithms/).


## How to contribute

For each session write up, please create a markdown file in the root of this repository, containing your write up. 
Please keep to the following naming scheme:

    s0X_TOPIC.md

where X should be replaced by your session number and TOPIC should be replaced by your topic.

Please also edit index.md to contain a new line in the table of contents, containing your name, a link to your github profile, and a link to your markdown file.
I (Pascal) will upload your screencast from the session as a pdf and add a link. 

Once your markdown file is committed, github will automatically compile it to html and publish it on the [seminar homepage](pwelke.github.io/SeminarFromTheoryToAlgorithms/).
This might take up to one minute (but is usually faster).
You might need to hard-refresh the page in your browser to see the changes.

### Formulas

Your markdown file might contain latex math mode formulas with certain drawbacks. 
To see examples that work, consider the seminar homepage of last semester:

- [Homepage](pwelke.github.io/SeminarLearningTheory/)
- [GitHub Project](github.com/pwelke/SeminarLearningTheory/)
